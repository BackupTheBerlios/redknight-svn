		   README - Cavalier Bot Toolkit  
	The Cavalier Bot Toolkit (or CTK) is a modular toolkit for bot creation
for the MMORPG Eternal Lands, but can quite easily be modified to function 
as a bot/automated client on any other protocol-based TCP/IP connection. It is 
distributed with two example/pre-built bot, Spartan and Merchant.

	For updates, fixes, and newer distributions, see 
http://redknight.berlios.de . From there, you can get the source, binary
builds, and contribute patches for code and documentation. Also, from the
project summary page ( http://developer.berlios.de/projects/redknight/ )
allows you to report bugs, use mailing lists, and browse the bleeding-edge
source code on subversion.

	The notes/ directory contains additional information, including the
license for the source code (COPYING.txt, installation instructions 
(INSTALL.txt), a list of contributors and contributions (CONTRIBUTORS.txt),
and news and feature announcements (NEWS.txt). Additional 
documentation for the respective bots can be found in doc/Spartan and 
doc/Merchant, while info about the underlying API embedded in the toolkit 
(which qualifies as a project in itself) can be located in doc/api. The 
contents of doc/code-doc contains documentation on the additional
functionalities of the toolkit. Finally, the sourceof the documentation (in
DocBook format) can be found under doc/docbook-source.

	Please contact me at crusadingknight @berlios.de (removing the
space) if you have any flames, comments, or ideas to get out; better yet, 
post these to  the CTK Mailing List, and let the community hear your thoughts.
